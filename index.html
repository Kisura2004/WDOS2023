        </h2>
        <p class="intro">
            Sea turtles are amazing animals that have spent millions of years living in our oceans. These animals hold a special place in the hearts of both locals and tourists in Sri Lanka. Five of the seven species of sea turtles are found on the island, including the Green turtle, Olive Ridley, Hawksbill turtle , Loggerhead, and Leatherback turtles. However, because of human activities and climate change, these incredible species are in danger.

Different species of sea turtles like to eat different kinds of food. Sea turtles have mouths and jaws that are specially formed to help them eat the foods they like. And each species of sea turtle eats, sleeps, mates and swims in distinctly different areas. Sometimes their habitats overlap, but for the most part they each have different preferences.</b></p></td>
